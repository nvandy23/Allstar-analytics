## Icebox features (for future implementation):
- Implement OAuth for user authentication, enabling users to log in. This feature allows users to create a personalized favorites list by marking their preferred players.
- Provide users with the ability to sort search results by player position and alphabetical order. This additional flexibility enhances the user experience in finding specific players.
- Extend the player statistics display to include seasonal data, not just career averages. Present this information in a visually appealing table format to ensure a clean and organized user interface.
- Optimize the design for mobile devices to ensure a seamless and user-friendly experience across various screen sizes. This responsiveness enhances accessibility and usability for users on the go.
